# kdl_kinematics_plugin/KDLKinematicsPlugin. 
# This plugin is likely a Kinematics Dynamics Library (KDL) based solver for computing inverse kinematics solutions.

# kinematics_solver_search_resolution:
# Sets the search resolution for the kinematics solver. 
# In the context of inverse kinematics, this might represent the precision or granularity with which the solver searches for a ...
# ... valid joint configuration that satisfies a given end-effector pose. A smaller value generally implies a more fine-grained search.

# kinematics_solver_timeout:
# Specifies the timeout for the kinematics solver. If the solver takes longer than this timeout to find a solution,...
# ... it might terminate without providing a result. The value is set to 0.05 seconds, indicating a relatively short time limit for solving ...
# ... the inverse kinematics problem.
